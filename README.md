## 🛣️ Android Development Roadmap using Kotlin (Industry-Ready)

---

### 📍 **Stage 1: Kotlin & Programming Basics**
> Goal: Understand Kotlin and basic programming constructs

- ✅ Kotlin Syntax & Basics  
  - Variables, Data Types, Loops, Conditionals  
  - Functions & Lambdas  
  - Collections, Null Safety  
  - Extension Functions, Scope Functions (`let`, `apply`, `also`, etc.)

- ✅ OOP in Kotlin  
  - Classes, Objects, Inheritance  
  - Interfaces, Abstract Classes  
  - Sealed Classes & Enums

- ✅ Functional Programming Concepts  
  - Higher-order functions  
  - Immutability  
  - Kotlin Coroutines Basics

---

### 📍 **Stage 2: Android Fundamentals with Jetpack Compose**
> Goal: Build basic apps with modern UI using Compose

- ✅ Jetpack Compose Basics  
  - Composables, Recomposition, State  
  - `remember`, `mutableStateOf`, `State` vs `LiveData`  
  - Layouts: `Column`, `Row`, `Box`, `LazyColumn`  
  - Theming, Material3 Design

- ✅ Navigation  
  - Jetpack Compose Navigation  
  - Compose Destinations (for type-safe navigation)

- ✅ ViewModel & Lifecycle  
  - ViewModel (from `androidx.lifecycle`)  
  - Lifecycle-aware components  
  - `StateFlow`, `LiveData`, `collectAsState()`

- ✅ Permissions, Intents, and Storage  
  - Camera, Storage Access  
  - Content Providers, Media Picker  
  - Runtime Permissions (with `ActivityResultLauncher`)

---

### 📍 **Stage 3: Architecture & Clean Code**
> Goal: Write scalable, maintainable apps

- ✅ MVVM Architecture (Model-View-ViewModel)  
- ✅ Repository Pattern  
- ✅ Use Cases & Domain Layer  
- ✅ Clean Architecture (3-layered)  
- ✅ SOLID Principles & Clean Code Practices

---

### 📍 **Stage 4: Dependency Injection (DI)**
> Goal: Manage dependencies like a pro

- ✅ Dagger Hilt (official DI for Android)  
  - `@HiltAndroidApp`, `@Inject`, `@Provides`, `@Singleton`  
  - ViewModel Injection  
  - Scoped Modules (`ActivityScoped`, `ViewModelScoped`)

---

### 📍 **Stage 5: Data Persistence & Local Storage**
> Goal: Handle local data

- ✅ Room Database  
  - Entities, DAOs, Migrations  
  - One-to-many & Many-to-many relationships  
  - Flow + Room  
  - TypeConverters

- ✅ DataStore (Modern alternative to SharedPreferences)  
  - Proto DataStore (for typed data)

---

### 📍 **Stage 6: Networking**
> Goal: Make network/API calls efficiently

- ✅ Retrofit with Kotlin Coroutines  
  - `@GET`, `@POST`, `@Query`, `@Body`  
  - JSON Parsing (Moshi or Gson)  
  - Error Handling (try-catch, Result Wrappers)

- ✅ Best Practices  
  - Use Repository + UseCase  
  - Sealed Classes for API responses (Success, Error, Loading)

---

### 📍 **Stage 7: Advanced Android Topics**
> Goal: Learn production-level concepts

- ✅ Background Work  
  - WorkManager (for deferrable tasks)  
  - Foreground Services (for long-running tasks)  
  - Accessibility Services (for special use cases like AppBlockers)

- ✅ Firebase Integration  
  - Firebase Auth, Firestore, FCM  
  - Analytics & Crashlytics

- ✅ Testing  
  - Unit Testing (JUnit, MockK)  
  - UI Testing with Compose  
  - Testable Architecture (Fake Repositories)

---

### 📍 **Stage 8: App Deployment & CI/CD**
> Goal: Ship and maintain your app

- ✅ App Signing & Release Builds  
- ✅ Play Store Deployment  
- ✅ Versioning & ProGuard  
- ✅ CI/CD with GitHub Actions or Bitrise  
- ✅ Crash Reporting & Analytics

---

### 📍 **Stage 9: Portfolio + Projects**
> Goal: Prove your skills

Build at least **2–3 real-world apps** with:
- Jetpack Compose UI
- Clean Architecture + Hilt
- Room + Retrofit
- Dark Mode, Offline Mode, and Pagination
- Firebase or Local Notifications

Examples:
- To-Do List with Room + Compose
- News App with Retrofit + Paging 3
- App Blocker using Accessibility Services
- Chat App with Firebase
